# metr-stats

Bayesian 2PL item response theory reanalysis of the METR benchmark data (Kwa et al. 2025). Fits four trajectory shapes (linear, quadratic, power-law, saturating) to model ability over time, computes horizon forecasts with credible intervals, and renders a blog post via Quarto. Run `just` to fit all models and render, or `just fit` / `just blog` separately.
